Instructions

This is simpy a proof of concept. Many games are possible, it will just be a matter of adding in different software. Getting feedback on how the system would be used is important.

Run 1 of each of


#python Webvirtualcontrollers.py
python RegisterController.py
python basiclessoncontroller.py
twistd -noy twistedserver.py

Navigate to

localhost:9001/

This has three options.

Make a buzzer
-- This creates a buzzer that is used for testing purposes. There is also a virtual LED that displays what the real LED should do.

Make a teacher controller
-- This is the controls just for the teacher. You can start a lesson, select a new 

Make a display

-- This forms a webpage that acts as a display for the lesson. It updates automatically 


localhost:9001/randomid/webbuzzer
"ditto"/webteacher (unimplemented)
"ditto"/webdisplay.html (unimplemented)

Randomid sets the virtual id of the device, so you can pretend to be more than one buzzer

Then:

Press buttons!
Rewrite crappy bits

Overview 
========

The system works on a bunch of servers basis where the programs communicate via json over UDP.

Twistedserver.py 
----------------

This is the webserver it acts as virtual handset, display and controller for the teacher.It also passes back the information to the web

 UDP
